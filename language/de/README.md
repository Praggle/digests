If you have installed this extension and you would like to add German language too, do the following steps:

1. Search for the correct version in 'branches' (e.G. 3.2.0-RC7-DE) 

2. Click on "Clone or Download" and select "Download as ZIP"

3. Once downloaded, unzip the zip file to a temporary location.

4. In the temporary location you will find folder digests\language\ In this folder there is a directory "de". 
Copy it to your web server - to the phpBB installation, folder ext/phpbbservices/digests/language. You will find folder "en" 
there; copy the "de" next to it.


If you need an older version of the translation (compatible to an older version of the Digests), select the corresponding branch.
